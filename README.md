# Baseball-Game
Simple baseball game I created to help work on some of the skills I learned in class.

The point of the game is to score as many runs as you can before you get three outs. 
Every time you guess the pitch correctly, you get a hit. 
If you strike out, then you lose a base runner.
And at the end it prints your game stats.
